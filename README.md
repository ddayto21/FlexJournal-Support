## Privacy Policy

Effective Date: January 2026

FlexJournal is designed to respect your privacy and minimize data collection.

Data Collection

FlexJournal does not require an account and does not collect personal information by default.

All workout data, including exercises, sets, reps, weights, notes, goals, and progress metrics, is stored locally on your device. FlexJournal does not transmit this data to external servers.

Data Storage

Workout data is stored on-device using local storage. Progress photos, if added, are stored locally on your device and are not uploaded or shared.

FlexJournal does not perform background data collection, analytics tracking, or behavioral profiling.

Data Sharing

FlexJournal does not sell, share, or transmit user data to third parties.

No advertising, tracking SDKs, or third-party analytics services are used.

Data Export

Users may export their workout data manually from the app. Exported data is under the user’s control once shared outside the app.

Third-Party Services

FlexJournal does not integrate with third-party services that collect personal data.

If this changes in the future (for example, optional cloud sync or backups), this policy will be updated accordingly.

Children’s Privacy

FlexJournal is not intended for use by children under the age of 13.

Changes to This Policy

This privacy policy may be updated as the app evolves. Any changes will be reflected in updated versions of the app and documentation.
